# Wiki Server

A simple webserver written in [python](https://www.python.org/) with [bottlepy](http://bottlepy.org/), [markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) and [sqlalchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

Use this sample code as a start for a web based project.

To run this software you need python 2.7 and also to install: bottle, sqlalchemy, markdown, bottle-sqlalchemy, beaker, cherrypy.

```sh
pip install bottle sqlalchemy markdown bottle-sqlalchemy beaker cherrypy
```
With this solution you create wiki pages on demand.

Dead links or non existent wiki pages are shown with line-through style.

Also you have access to all previous versions of wiki pages.

License-free software.
 
Feel free to use this software for both personal and commercial usage.
